Crystal Collector Game

This game randomly assigns the user an number and 4 gems are given random values. The computer generates a random number that the user has to try to match by clicking on the four gems. when the computers number and users number is matched it records one win. If not it records a loss. The HTML and CSS is made up by me and the functionality is powered by Javascript.
